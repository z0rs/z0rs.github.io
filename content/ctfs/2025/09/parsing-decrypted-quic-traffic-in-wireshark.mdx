So I was tryna cook a 4n6 CTF chall 4 [ISC2 SG Youth Wing](https://www.isc2chapter.sg/youth-wing).  
Plan was: ppl gotta decrypt HTTPS traffic w/ `SSLKEYLOGFILE` n pull out the HTTP objs.  

But bruh… HTTP/3 pulled up. New browsers n servers already vibin w/ it, so sht got messy fast.  
So here’s some quick tips n hacks I found when playin w/ QUIC + TLS 1.3 in Wireshark 🕵️‍♂️  

## HTTP/3 (QUIC + TLS1.3)  

> Born 2018, locked as std 2022, now >95% browsers n ~36% top sites rollin w/ it.  
{:.prompt-tip}  

Diff from HTTP/2?  
- HTTP/2 = TCP + TLS stack  
- HTTP/3 = QUIC (UDP) + TLS1.3, all fused up, faster n harder to kill  

Sample files if u wanna vibe along:  
- [traffic.pcapng](https://blog.elmo.sg/assets/posts/2025-09-07-parsing-decrypted-quic-traffic-in-wireshark/traffic.pcapng)  
- [sslkey.log](https://blog.elmo.sg/assets/posts/2025-09-07-parsing-decrypted-quic-traffic-in-wireshark/sslkey.log)  

## Wireshark deep dive  

Open `traffic.pcapng` → u see QUIC spam. Still encrypted cuz TLS1.3.  
No decrypt, no fun.  

### Decrypting  

Same drill like old TLS stuff.  
Load ur `sslkeylog` in Wireshark:  
`Edit > Prefs > Protocols > TLS > (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename`  

![sslkeylog](https://blog.elmo.sg/assets/posts/2025-09-07-parsing-decrypted-quic-traffic-in-wireshark/tlskeylogfile.png)  

Now u see HTTP/3 frames, yay. But ctrl+F? nah fam. Export objects? nope. Streams? dead end.  

### Parsing headers  

Peek a pkt → Wireshark shows HTTP headers. Cool but digging 1by1 = pain.  

![http3 pkt](https://blog.elmo.sg/assets/posts/2025-09-07-parsing-decrypted-quic-traffic-in-wireshark/decrypted_http3_packet.png)  

Quick hack: right-click `http3.headers.header.value` → apply as column.  
Boom, all headers side-by-side.  

![headers col](https://blog.elmo.sg/assets/posts/2025-09-07-parsing-decrypted-quic-traffic-in-wireshark/getting_the_response_file.png) 

Still noisy af tho. Best move:  
`File > Export Packet Dissections > As CSV` → clean it up later in Excel/Python/whatever.  

### Extracting files via HTTP/3  

Export Objects still dead. So… manual grind:  

1. Find GET req of ur file  
2. Click resp pkt  
3. Spot the DOT pkt (last frag)  
4. Click that → bottom right: `Reassembled QUIC` → file shows up  

![resp](https://blog.elmo.sg/assets/posts/2025-09-07-parsing-decrypted-quic-traffic-in-wireshark/identifying_the_response.png)  
![reasm](https://blog.elmo.sg/assets/posts/2025-09-07-parsing-decrypted-quic-traffic-in-wireshark/getting_the_response_file.png)  

Copy raw bytes → save as hex stream → Python `bytes.fromhex()` → boom u got ur file back.  

## Wrap up  

Honestly looked ez on paper but ate my time ngl 💀.  
These tricks lowkey saved me when playin w/ QUIC.  

If u got cooler hacks or smoother Wireshark workflows, hmu on Discord `@0x3n0`{:.filepath}.  

Peace out ✌️

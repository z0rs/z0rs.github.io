So, you got yourself a **Magic Mouse 2** and you're running **Arch Linux**? Good luck, buddy. Unlike macOS, this ain't plug-and-play. But no worries, I got you covered. Let's get that slick Apple mouse working properly.

## 🔧 Step 1: Connect via Bluetoothctl

First things first, fire up a terminal and run:

```bash
bluetoothctl
```

Once inside, make sure Bluetooth is up and running:

```bash
power on
agent on
scan on
```

Wait for your **Magic Mouse 2** to pop up (you’ll see something like this):

```bash
[NEW] Device A8:91:3D:40:CB:7A Magic Mouse 2
```

Now, pair it up:

```bash
pair A8:91:3D:40:CB:7A
trust A8:91:3D:40:CB:7A
connect A8:91:3D:40:CB:7A
```

Boom! You should see `Connection successful`. If not, you probably need to sacrifice a goat to the Arch gods. 🐐

## 🛠️ Step 2: Load the Right Driver

If the mouse connects but **won’t move**, you gotta make sure the **hid-magicmouse** module is loaded:

```bash
sudo modprobe hid-magicmouse
```

To make it **persistent** across reboots:

```bash
echo 'hid-magicmouse' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules-load.d/hid-magicmouse.conf
```

## ⚡ Step 3: Prevent Auto-Suspend (Annoying as Hell)

By default, Linux tries to save power by putting Bluetooth devices to sleep. Bad idea for a mouse. Let’s disable that:

```bash
echo "options hid-magicmouse scroll_acceleration=1 scroll_speed=50" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/magicmouse.conf
```

Then reload the module:

```bash
sudo modprobe -r hid-magicmouse && sudo modprobe hid-magicmouse
```

## 🚀 Step 4: Auto-Connect on Boot

Hate reconnecting manually every time you restart? Let’s automate it with **systemd**.

Create a new service:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/bluetooth-autoconnect.service
```

Paste this in:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Auto-connect Magic Mouse 2
After=bluetooth.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bluetoothctl connect A8:91:3D:40:CB:7A
Restart=always
User=root

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Save and exit (CTRL+X, Y, ENTER), then enable it:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth-autoconnect.service
sudo systemctl start bluetooth-autoconnect.service
```

Now, your **Magic Mouse 2 will auto-connect on startup** like it’s supposed to. 🎉

## 🎯 Done!

That’s it, folks! Now you can enjoy using your **Magic Mouse 2 on Arch Linux** without going insane. If something breaks (because it’s Linux, duh), drop into **bluetoothctl** and reconnect manually.

Now go flex on your friends who still use Windows. 😎

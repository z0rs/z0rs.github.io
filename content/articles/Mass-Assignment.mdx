Alright, you’ve probably heard about the `OWASP Top 10`, the ultimate hall of shame for web app security nightmares. But did you know OWASP also has a hit list just for API security? Yup, it’s called the `OWASP API Security Top 10`, and here’s the rundown:

- Broken Object Level Authorization
- Broken User Authentication
- Excessive Data Exposure
- Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting
- Broken Function Level Authorization
- Mass Assignment
- Security Misconfiguration
- Injection
- Improper Assets Management
- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

Today, we’re zooming in on one of the sneakiest API security flaws—**Mass Assignment**. Sounds harmless, right? But this bad boy can straight-up wreck your app’s security. Let’s break it down with an example.

## API Security and Object Properties 101

So, apps usually deal with objects that hold a bunch of properties. Think of a `user` object in an app—could look something like this:

```json
{ 
  "id": 1337, 
  "name": "eno", 
  "location": "Blk 335 Smith Street, SG", 
  "admin": false, 
  "group_membership": [121, 322, 457] 
}
```

Now, a regular user should only be tweaking harmless fields like `name` and `location`, not touching serious stuff like `admin` status or `group_membership`. But here’s where things get dicey.

## Mass Assignment: The Silent Killer

Mass Assignment is what happens when an app just blindly accepts whatever the user throws at it and updates object properties without checking. If your API isn’t carefully filtering inputs, a sneaky attacker can go from "just another user" to "admin boss mode" in seconds.

Let’s say your app lets users update their names with a simple request:

### OWASP API Security Example #1: Mass Assignment

```http
PUT /api/v1.1/user/1337
{ 
  "name": "eno" 
}
```

Looks innocent enough. But what if someone gets a little creative?

```http
PUT /api/v1.1/user/1337
{ 
  "name": "enogans", 
  "admin": true 
}
```

If your app isn’t locking down which fields can be changed, boom—this user just upgraded themselves to admin status. Not exactly what you had in mind, huh?

### OWASP API Security Example #2: Mass Assignment

```http
PUT /api/v1.1/user/1337
{ 
  "name": "eno", 
  "admin": true, 
  "group_membership": [1, 35, 121, 322, 457] 
}
```

Now they’re adding themselves to VIP groups too? Yeah, this is why Mass Assignment is a total disaster if not handled right.

## How to Keep Mass Assignment in Check

If you don’t want your app getting played like a cheap fiddle, here’s what you gotta do:

- Disable Mass Assignment in your framework if possible.
- Use whitelists to specify exactly which fields users can update.
- Double-check and sanitize inputs like your security depends on it—because it does.

Stay sharp, lock down your API, and don’t let Mass Assignment turn your app into a hacker’s playground!

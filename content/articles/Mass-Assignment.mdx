You might have heard of the `OWASP Top 10`, a widely recognized list of the most critical security risks affecting web applications. Similarly, OWASP also publishes a list of the `Top 10 API Security Risks` that are specific to APIs, known as the `OWASP API Security Top 10`. Here’s the current list:

- Broken Object Level Authorization
- Broken User Authentication
- Excessive Data Exposure
- Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting
- Broken Function Level Authorization
- Mass Assignment
- Security Misconfiguration
- Injection
- Improper Assets Management
- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

In this article, we’ll focus on one of the top API security vulnerabilities, **Mass Assignment**. Mass Assignment occurs when an application assigns values to multiple object properties simultaneously. But how does this feature turn into a security vulnerability? Let’s dive into an example.

## Understanding API Security and Object Properties

Application objects often come with numerous properties defining their attributes. For example, consider a `user` object used to store user information in an application. This object might contain properties such as `user ID`, `name`, `location`, and so forth.

```json
{ 
  "id": 1337, 
  "name": "eno", 
  "location": "Blk 335 Smith Street, SG", 
  "admin": false, 
  "group_membership": [121, 322, 457] 
}
```

In this case, users should only be allowed to modify certain properties, such as `location` and `name`. However, other parts of this user object, like `admin` (indicating whether the user has administrative rights) and `group_membership` (tracking user group affiliations), should be restricted from user modification.

## API Security Mass Assignment Vulnerability

Mass Assignment is a vulnerability where user input is improperly assigned to sensitive data fields like `password`, `permissions`, or `admin status`, leading to unauthorized modifications.

This vulnerability surfaces when an application automatically maps user inputs to multiple program variables or object properties without validation. While this feature can simplify application development in many frameworks, it also enables attackers to overwrite, alter, or create new properties within objects. For instance, consider a scenario where a site allows users to update their name with a PUT request like this, changing user `1337`'s name from `eno` to `enogans`.

### OWASP API Security Example #1: Mass Assignment

```http
PUT /api/v1.1/user/1337
{ 
  "name": "eno" 
}
```

Now, what happens if the user sends a request like this?

```http
PUT /api/v1.1/user/1337
{ 
  "name": "enogans", 
  "admin": true 
}
```

If the application relies on Mass Assignment to update object properties, this request could also update the `admin` field, granting administrative rights to user `1337`. This is the essence of the Mass Assignment vulnerability, where unauthorized fields are open for user modification. Similarly, users might add themselves to restricted groups by assigning new group values.

### OWASP API Security Example #2: Mass Assignment

```http
PUT /api/v1.1/user/1337
{ 
  "name": "eno", 
  "admin": true, 
  "group_membership": [1, 35, 121, 322, 457] 
}
```

## Preventing Mass Assignment

To mitigate Mass Assignment vulnerabilities, disable Mass Assignment in your application framework or implement whitelisting to control accessible properties or variables. Ensuring that only specified fields are assignable by the user can prevent unauthorized modifications and significantly strengthen security.

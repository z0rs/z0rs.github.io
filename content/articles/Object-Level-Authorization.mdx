In the world of modern apps, APIs are the backboneâ€”handling data, running the show, and unfortunately, making juicy targets for attackers. Thatâ€™s why knowing API security inside-out isnâ€™t just an option; itâ€™s a **must** if you donâ€™t wanna be the next data breach headline.

## OWASP API Security - Broken Object Level Authorization

Youâ€™ve probably heard of **OWASPâ€™s Top 10** web app vulnerabilities, right? Well, APIs get their own **API Security Top 10**, and at the very top of the list? **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)**â€”aka the hackerâ€™s golden ticket to your sensitive data. Hereâ€™s the full hit list:

- Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)
- Broken User Authentication
- Excessive Data Exposure
- Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting
- Broken Function Level Authorization
- Mass Assignment
- Security Misconfiguration
- Injection Attacks
- Improper Asset Management
- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

Most of these can mess up any part of your app, but APIs are often where they hit the hardest. Letâ€™s break down **BOLA** and why itâ€™s the **#1 enemy** for APIs.

### Whatâ€™s the Deal with Broken Object Level Authorization?

APIs often rely on object identifiers, and when they donâ€™t enforce **strict** access control, attackers can snatch data they have **zero** business accessing. Itâ€™s a problem across **REST, SOAP, GraphQLâ€”you name it.**

Hereâ€™s a **real-world mess-up**: Letâ€™s say an API exposes user payment info via `user_id`:

```url
https://api.example.com/v1.1/users/payment/show?user_id=12
```

If this API doesnâ€™t double-check **whoâ€™s asking**, anyone who figures out a valid `user_id` can waltz in and steal payment details. All it takes is some **guessing or brute-forcing IDs** to start a data heist.

Some APIs use object `IDs` instead of user IDs, which makes things **worse**. Check this out:

```url
https://api.example.com/v1.1/messages/show?id=1337
```

Without proper access control, an attacker can cycle through IDs (`id=1338`, `id=1339`, etc.) and pull **everyoneâ€™s** messages. Thatâ€™s **BOLA** in actionâ€”giving unauthorized users access to **whatever they want** just by tweaking an `ID`.

But waitâ€”it gets worse. If an attacker can also **update, delete, or create** records, the damage jumps to **a whole new level**. In `GraphQL` APIs, for example, changing the `ID` in a mutation request could let someone edit or wipe out someone elseâ€™s data.

### Why is This a Nightmare?

The level of chaos depends on **whatâ€™s exposed**. If an API leaks PII (Personally Identifiable Information), credentials, or financial details, attackers can:

- **Scrape** user data in bulk
- **Hijack accounts**
- **Sell stolen data** or **commit fraud**

Picture this: an **eCommerce API** leaks bank details and addresses. An **insurance API** leaks policyholder info. A **healthcare API** exposes medical records. See where this is going? Total disaster mode.

## Locking Down Object Level Authorization

To shut down **BOLA**, APIs need to **validate** user access **on every request**. That means:

- **Using access tokens** instead of trusting user input (no `user_id` in the URL, please)
- **Checking permissions at the object level** (just because youâ€™re logged in doesnâ€™t mean you can see *everything*)
- **Using unpredictable, secure object IDs** instead of plain numeric ones

For example, switching from:

```url
https://api.example.com/v1.1/messages/show?id=1337
```

to something like:

```url
https://api.example.com/v1.1/messages/show?id=d0c240ea139206019f692d
```

makes **brute-forcing way harder**. But donâ€™t rely on just thatâ€”**always enforce access control**.

Also, random IDs wonâ€™t save you if your API **blindly trusts** requests. If an attacker **snags a valid ID**, theyâ€™re still in. Thatâ€™s why **strict authentication & authorization checks** matter more than anything.

### Final Thoughts

If youâ€™re building or securing APIs, **Object Level Authorization should be at the top of your checklist**. Even with strong access controls, there are **other** attack vectors, so never sleep on security.

APIs **run the internet**, but if theyâ€™re not locked down properly, they **open the door for hackers**. Time to fix that.

Stay secure. ðŸ”¥

As modern applications grow more complex, APIs are often central to their design, enabling essential operations and transmitting sensitive data. This prevalence makes API vulnerabilities a widespread source of security risk and data breaches. Thus, understanding API vulnerabilities and how to safeguard against them is crucial.

## OWASP API Security - Broken Object Level Authorization

You may already know of the **Top 10 OWASP** list of critical web application vulnerabilities. Similarly, OWASP also curates an **API Security Top 10** list highlighting vulnerabilities specific to APIs. Among these, the top API vulnerability is **Broken Object Level Authorization**. Here’s the current list:

- Broken Object Level Authorization
- Broken User Authentication
- Excessive Data Exposure
- Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting
- Broken Function Level Authorization
- Mass Assignment
- Security Misconfiguration
- Injection
- Improper Asset Management
- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

While many of these vulnerabilities can affect components beyond APIs, they frequently appear within APIs. Let's dive deeper into **OWASP API Security #1: Broken Object Level Authorization**.

### Understanding Broken Object Level Authorization Vulnerability

APIs often expose object identifiers that users rely on to access resources. When proper access control is not implemented, attackers can view or manipulate resources they’re unauthorized to access. This vulnerability impacts all API architectures, including `SOAP`, `REST`, and `GraphQL`.

Here’s an example: Suppose an API allows users to retrieve payment details based on their `user_id`:

```url
https://api.example.com/v1.1/users/payment/show?user_id=12
```

If this API doesn’t enforce additional identity verification, returning the requested data to anyone who calls it, sensitive information could be exposed to attackers. By guessing or brute-forcing victim IDs, an attacker could steal payment information.

In many cases, applications allow users to access data objects using an object `ID` rather than user IDs. For example, `example.com` might have an API that lets users retrieve private messages by referencing a numeric `ID`:

```url
https://api.example.com/v1.1/messages/show?id=1337
```

If the server lacks access controls, an attacker could brute-force this numeric `ID` and retrieve other users' messages. This is a clear instance of **Broken Object Level Authorization**—a lack of identity checks allows users to access individual data objects without verification.

Beyond reading data objects, this vulnerability can also impact APIs that `update`, `delete`, or `create` data entries. In some `GraphQL` implementations, unauthorized users might alter data by simply changing the `ID` within the request.

### Why Broken Object Level Authorization is Dangerous

The impact of **Broken Object-Level Authorization** depends on the sensitivity of the data object exposed. If key objects like user PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or credentials are accessible, the vulnerability could result in significant data misuse or full application compromise.

More advanced attacks could involve automated scripts that scrape all user IDs and extract data in bulk. On an **eCommerce** site, for instance, attackers could potentially collect millions of bank account numbers, credit card details, and addresses. On a banking site, attackers might compromise users’ credit histories and tax forms.

## How to Prevent Broken Object Level Authorization

To prevent **Broken Object Level Authorization** vulnerabilities, it’s crucial to derive the `API` user's identity from an access token or other secret form. Then apply access control consistently across all sensitive `APIs` and request methods, auditing each endpoint thoroughly. Often, API implementations lack proper access controls, where merely switching request methods bypasses them.

If necessary, substitute random data values in place of simple numeric `IDs`. However, random IDs alone are not a foolproof solution, as they may leak or be compromised. Take this scenario where the API lacks access control:

```url
https://api.example.com/v1.1/messages/show?id=d0c240ea139206019f692d
```

While guessing this type of ID might be challenging, attackers could still compromise it through leaks or extensions monitoring browser history.

Ensuring **Object Level Authorization** is critical for developers. Even with adequate Object Level Authorization, APIs can remain vulnerable to other attacks. Implementing robust authentication mechanisms for API services can be complex but is essential for protecting sensitive data and preventing unauthorized access.

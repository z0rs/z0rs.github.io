You may have encountered the term `Top 10 OWASP`, which identifies the top ten vulnerabilities posing a threat to `Webapps`. OWASP regularly updates a list focusing on the most critical security risks affecting `APIs`, referred to as the `OWASP API Security Top 10`. The current API Top Ten includes:

- Broken Object Level Authorization
- Broken User Authentication
- Excessive Data Exposure
- Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting
- Broken Function Level Authorization
- Mass Assignment
- Security Misconfiguration
- Injection
- Improper Assets Management
- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

## OWASP API Security Injection

Injection attacks remain one of the most pervasive and impactful vulnerabilities affecting APIs. Here, we’ll explore `OWASP API Security #8`, **Injection**, a category that continues to affect a large share of applications and API systems.

Injection vulnerabilities are core to numerous risks, including `SQL Injection`, `OS Command Injection`, and `XML Injection`, and represent a significant portion of the vulnerabilities identified in both `apps` and `APIs`.

## How Does Injection Occur?

Simply put, injection occurs when an application fails to correctly separate untrusted user data from code.

Untrusted user data can enter through `HTTP request parameters`, `HTTP headers`, and `cookies`, as well as from stored database data or files modifiable by users. When an application does not handle untrusted user data properly before incorporating it into commands or queries, it risks interpreting this data as part of its command structure. This allows attackers to input data in ways that alter command logic or inject new commands.

For example, in `SQL Injection` attacks, attackers inject data to manipulate SQL commands. Similarly, in OS Injection attacks, attackers provide input that manipulates OS-level commands on the host server. Applications combining user data directly with commands or code can be highly susceptible.

Injection vulnerabilities affect `API` systems significantly as they serve as interfaces for user inputs to applications. Let’s examine how injection vulnerabilities manifest in `API` endpoints.

### OWASP API Security Injection Example #1: Retrieving a Blog Post

Suppose an `API` allows users to retrieve blog posts by sending a `GET` request like this:

```
GET /api/v1.1/posts?id=1337
```

This request would prompt the `API` to return post 1337. The server queries the database using an SQL statement, where `post_id` corresponds to the `id` provided by the user in the URL.

Now, consider this input:

```
GET /api/v1.1/posts?id=12358; DROP TABLE users
```

The `SQL` server interprets the `id` segment after the semicolon as an additional SQL command. It first executes the command to retrieve the blog post:

```
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE post_id = 1337;
```

Then, it executes this command, effectively deleting the `TABLE USERS` and compromising stored data:

```
DROP TABLE users
```

This example illustrates an `SQL Injection` attack, which occurs whenever user input is unsafely concatenated into an SQL query. Note that user input in `API` requests can arrive not only through URL parameters but also via `POST` requests and other sources, highlighting the need to secure all potential entry points.

### OWASP API Security Injection Example #2: Reading System Files

Suppose a site allows users to read uploaded files through the `API`:

```
GET /api/v1.1/files?id=1123581321
```

This request triggers the server to retrieve the specified user file using an OS command:

```
cat /var/www/html/users/tmp/1123581321
```

In this scenario, an attacker could inject additional commands into the system’s OS command by appending directives after a semicolon:

```
GET /api/v1.1/files?id=1123581321; rm -rf /var/www/html/users
```

This would prompt the server to delete the `/var/www/html/users` directory, potentially erasing critical user information stored by the application.

```
rm -rf /var/www/html/users
```

## Preventing Injection Vulnerabilities in OWASP API Security Injection

To defend against Injection attacks, it’s essential to recognize that data manipulation risks can emerge anytime data is processed, even in less obvious scenarios. Injection risks may stem from any part of untrusted data input, whether or not it directly interfaces with the application logic, potentially leading to severe damage to application data or users.

Effective Injection prevention involves validating, sanitizing, and neutralizing every piece of data entering an application. Even seemingly safe data can introduce risks if special characters are used to trigger attacks like SQL Injection. Therefore, it’s essential to classify data as either safe or unsafe, applying this distinction consistently across the application.

## Input Validation

One of the most effective mitigation strategies is validating untrusted data using a denylist or an allowlist. When using a denylist, restrict potentially impactful characters; when using an allowlist, only permit input containing predefined safe characters.

However, denylist implementations may be incomplete, as it can be challenging to identify every character impacting application components. Conversely, allowlists may be too restrictive, potentially blocking legitimate input, such as special characters. For example, if a user named OxO'Enogans registers, they should be allowed to include an apostrophe in their name.

To minimize Injection risks, validation must be complemented with secure server configurations, prepared statements in database queries, and role-based access control.

## Parameterization

Parameterization is a robust defense against Injection vulnerabilities. It involves compiling command logic prior to inserting user-supplied parameters. Instead of embedding user input directly into commands, applications should define command structure beforehand and incorporate user input just before command execution. While highly effective against various Injection risks, parameterization may not suit every code context.

## Escaping

Another mitigation tactic involves escaping special characters. Escaping encodes special characters within user input, treating them strictly as data rather than commands. By applying markers or syntax that differentiate special characters within input, escaping techniques help distinguish between data and executable content.

This approach, however, presents its own challenges. It requires using the correct `encoding` syntax for each downstream parser, as mismatches can lead to misinterpretation. Attackers may also bypass escapes by crafting input designed to undermine encoding attempts. Therefore, effective Injection prevention demands an understanding of how various parsers operate and an awareness of which parsers execute first in any processing sequence.

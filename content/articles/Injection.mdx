So, you’ve probably heard of `Top 10 OWASP`, right? That’s basically the VIP list of security nightmares haunting `Webapps`. OWASP keeps this list fresh, and when it comes to `APIs`, they drop the `OWASP API Security Top 10`. Here’s the current lineup of threats you should definitely not ignore:

- Broken Object Level Authorization
- Broken User Authentication
- Excessive Data Exposure
- Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting
- Broken Function Level Authorization
- Mass Assignment
- Security Misconfiguration
- Injection
- Improper Assets Management
- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

## OWASP API Security Injection

Injection attacks are still out here ruining everyone’s day. We’re talking about `OWASP API Security #8`, **Injection**—a classic security fail that refuses to die. 

These bad boys cover everything from `SQL Injection`, `OS Command Injection`, to `XML Injection`. And trust me, if your app’s got an injection hole, hackers are gonna slide right in.

## How Does Injection Happen?

Long story short, it happens when apps don’t keep untrusted user input separate from legit code. 

Attackers love slipping their junk into `HTTP request parameters`, `headers`, `cookies`, or even database records. If your app lazily shoves user input into commands without checking, boom—you just gave hackers a free pass to mess with your system.

Think of it like letting a shady dude into your house just because he “knows your name.” Not smart, right?

### OWASP API Security Injection Example #1: Blog Post Madness

Let’s say your `API` serves up blog posts when users send this request:

```
GET /api/v1.1/posts?id=1337
```

Cool, so the API fetches post `1337`. The server does its thing with an SQL query like this:

```
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE post_id = 1337;
```

Now, a hacker rolls up and tries this:

```
GET /api/v1.1/posts?id=12358; DROP TABLE users
```

That SQL server? Yeah, it’s about to have a really bad day:

```
DROP TABLE users;
```

Just like that, all user data goes **poof**. This is `SQL Injection` 101, and if you’re concatenating user input straight into queries, you might as well hand out your database passwords too.

### OWASP API Security Injection Example #2: Bye-Bye System Files

Now let’s talk OS Injection. Say your API lets users read uploaded files:

```
GET /api/v1.1/files?id=1123581321
```

The server runs this:

```
cat /var/www/html/users/tmp/1123581321
```

But then a sneaky attacker pulls up and tries:

```
GET /api/v1.1/files?id=1123581321; rm -rf /var/www/html/users
```

Yeah, that `rm -rf` command? It just nuked your whole user directory. **GG, no re.**

## How to NOT Get Wrecked by Injection Attacks

Injection attacks can wreck your data, your users, and your whole rep. But you can fight back. Here’s how:

### Input Validation: Don’t Trust, Always Verify

Sanitize everything. Set up **allowlists** (only accept legit characters) or **denylists** (block shady ones). But be careful—denylists can miss stuff, and allowlists can be too strict. Imagine blocking apostrophes and telling O’Malley he can’t sign up. Awkward.

### Parameterization: Keep It Clean

Instead of shoving user input into your commands raw, **use parameterized queries**. This keeps your queries and input separate, like food and poison. Wanna avoid an injection mess? This is your best bet.

### Escaping: Tell Special Characters to Chill

Escaping turns potential attack characters into harmless data. Just make sure your escaping method matches the backend. Mess that up, and hackers will have a field day breaking your defenses.

Bottom line? Injection vulnerabilities are **hella dangerous**. If you’re not securing your APIs, you’re basically inviting hackers to the party. Lock it down, sanitize inputs, and stay paranoid. Security ain’t a one-time thing—it’s a **lifestyle**.

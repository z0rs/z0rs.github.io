## Executive Summary
In this report, we provide an overview of the security posture of the target system, detailing findings and their respective severities. The assessment is based on a comprehensive analysis of potential vulnerabilities and risks using the CVSS 3.0 and 3.1 scoring frameworks. Each finding is described along with its associated risk score and recommendations for remediation.

## Scope and Methodology

The security assessment focused on evaluating vulnerabilities within the target system's web application component. This included an examination of the application's source code, configurations, and user interactions. The assessment also encompassed the underlying infrastructure, database, and session management mechanisms. However, it's important to note that the assessment did not cover the network perimeter, physical security, or external dependencies outside the scope of the application.

1. **Reconnaissance:** Gathered information about the target system, including technologies, frameworks, and application endpoints.
2. **Vulnerability Identification:** Utilized automated scanning tools and manual testing techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities.
3. **Vulnerability Verification:** Conducted further manual testing to validate and confirm the identified vulnerabilities.
4. **Risk Assessment:** Evaluated the impact and exploitability of each vulnerability using the CVSS 3.0 and 3.1 scoring frameworks.
5. **Remediation Recommendations:** Provided actionable recommendations for fixing identified vulnerabilities, following best practices and security guidelines.

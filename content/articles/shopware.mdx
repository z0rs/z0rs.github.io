### Overview:
Shopware is an open-source e-commerce platform built on the Symfony Framework and Vue.js. The default storefront, Shopware 6 Storefront, uses Twig and Bootstrap. Customizable with extensions, users can override Twig template files to personalize the appearance via the Shopware 6 Admin panel.

This article highlights a bypass of CVE-2023-22731, tracked as issue [NEXT-24667](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/security-updates/security-update-01-2023) by Shopware.

A vulnerability in `Shopware\Core\Framework\Adapter\Twig\SecurityExtension` allows bypassing validation checks. This extension was introduced in commit `89d1ea1` to counter CVE-2023-22731 by overriding Twig filters such as `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, and `sort()`. However, a flaw in validation occurs as it checks only string arguments, enabling an array argument to bypass the check.

Thus, a remote attacker can invoke PHP functions and execute commands by accessing a Twig environment without the Sandbox extension, referencing callables with fully-qualified names as arrays of strings.

### Summary:

| Product               | Shopware                                     |
| ----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Vendor                | Shopware AG                                  |
| Severity              | High - Users with Shopware Admin login access may obtain remote code/command execution |
| Affected Versions     | v6.4.18.1 - v6.4.20.0, v6.5.0.0-rc1 - v6.5.0.0-rc4 (Commit facfc88)|
| Tested Versions       | v6.4.20.0 (Latest stable), v6.5.0.0-rc3 (Latest pre-release)|
| CVE Identifier        | CVE-2023-2017                                |
| Description           | Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) allows remote attackers with access to bypass `SecurityExtension` validation in `Shopware\Core\Framework\Adapter\Twig` and execute arbitrary code via callables. Update to v6.4.20.1 to resolve.|
| CWE                   | CWE-184, CWE-1336                            |

### CVSS3.1 Scoring:

- **Base Score**: 8.8 (High)
- **Vector String**: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`

The vulnerability can be exploited over the network with low complexity, needing only low-level privileges.

### Vulnerability Details:

The vulnerability is in `SecurityExtension.php` under `src/Core/Framework/Adapter/Twig/`:

```php
class SecurityExtension extends AbstractExtension {
    // code omitted for brevity
    public function map(iterable $array, string|callable|\Closure $function): array {
        if (\is_string($function) && !\in_array($function, $this->allowedPHPFunctions, true)) {
            throw new \RuntimeException(sprintf('Function "%s" is not allowed', $function));
        }
        // Further code omitted
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
The vulnerability lies in callable validation within `map()`, `reduce()`, `filter()`, and `sort()` functions. The check bypasses validation if `function` is an array. When an array is passed, dangerous or unsafe PHP functions can be executed.

Developers may mistakenly assume callable types must be strings, which is untrue as documented in PHP. This means calls to functions as arrays (e.g., `['Class', 'method']`) are valid.

#### Exploiting Devices:

1. **Using `CacheValueCompressor::uncompress()` to invoke `unserialize()`**:
   Generate a serialized payload with `phpggc`:
   ```bash
   ./phpggc -b Monolog/RCE8 system 'id'
   ```
   Compress payload:
   ```bash
   php -r 'echo gzcompress(shell_exec("php phpggc Monolog/RCE8 system id"));' | hexdump -v -e '"\\\x" 1/1 "%02X"'
   ```

This vulnerability exposes a system running Shopware to code injection via unsafe PHP functions when array arguments bypass `SecurityExtension` validation. 

**Important**: Upgrade to v6.4.20.1 to mitigate this risk effectively.

*API Security: Function Level Authorization*

As modern applications increasingly depend on APIs, securing these interfaces is essential. In this *API Security 101* series, we’ll dive into common API vulnerabilities, the reasons behind them, and the best ways to protect your application.

You've likely heard of the OWASP Top 10 for web applications, which covers critical security vulnerabilities. Similarly, OWASP has a Top 10 list specifically for APIs, the **OWASP API Security Top 10**, which currently includes:

- Broken Object Level Authorization
- Broken User Authentication
- Excessive Data Exposure
- Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting
- Broken Function Level Authorization
- Mass Assignment
- Security Misconfiguration
- Injection
- Improper Asset Management
- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring  

Today, let’s take a closer look at: **OWASP API Security #5: Broken Function Level Authorization.**

## Understanding Broken Function Level Authorization

Before diving into this vulnerability, you might find it useful to read my post on [OWASP API Security Broken Object Level Authorization](https://z0rs.github.io/object-level-authorization/). In brief, APIs often expose object identifiers that provide access to resources, and when access control isn’t properly enforced, attackers may gain access to unauthorized resources.

Similarly, **Broken Function Level Authorization** occurs when applications fail to restrict sensitive functions to authorized users. Unlike object-level authorization issues, function-level vulnerabilities specifically allow unauthorized users to access restricted functions, often due to missing or misconfigured access controls.

For example, this flaw might allow a standard user to modify another user’s account or enable a user to access admin-level functionality on the site. Let’s examine a few real-world scenarios where these flaws might appear.

### Example 1: Deleting Another User’s Post

Imagine an API that lets users retrieve blog posts with a `GET` request to an endpoint like this:

```
GET /api/v1.1/user/1337/posts?id=32
```

This request returns post 32 from user 1337. Since all posts are public, any user can send this request to view others' posts. However, only the original author (user 1337) should be able to edit or delete their own post.

What if the API doesn’t apply the same restrictions on `PUT` and `DELETE` methods? In this case, any user could modify or delete someone else’s post by simply changing the HTTP method, like so:

```
DELETE /api/v1.1/user/1337/posts?id=32
```

### Example 2: Impersonating an Admin

Let’s say the platform allows admins to manage users’ posts, with requests that only succeed when sent from an admin account:

```
DELETE /api/v1.1/user/1337/posts?id=32
POST /api/v1.1/user/1337/posts?id=32
PUT /api/v1.1/user/1337/posts?id=32
```

The platform identifies admins based on a specific header in the request:

```
Admin: 1
```

A malicious user could add this header to their requests to gain access to admin functions. This type of vulnerability exposes sensitive functionality due to poorly implemented or missing access controls.

### Example 3: Leaving the Door Unlocked

Finally, consider an admin-only API endpoint that provides site statistics:

```
GET /api/v1.1/site/stats/hd216zla
```

This endpoint does not enforce user-based restrictions, relying instead on an obscure string at the URL’s end to prevent unauthorized access. This tactic, called *Security through Obscurity*, attempts to enhance security by concealing information from unauthorized users.

However, security through obscurity is unreliable. If an attacker finds this URL, they could access sensitive functionality and data.

### Potential Impact of Broken Function Level Authorization

The extent of damage an attacker can cause with `broken function level authorization` depends on the accessible functionality. Attackers might impersonate other users, access restricted data, modify others' accounts, or even gain site admin privileges.

To prevent `broken function level authorization`, it’s crucial to implement detailed, role-based access controls. These controls should be consistently applied, regardless of request method, header, or URL parameters.

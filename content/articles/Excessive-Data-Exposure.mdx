You might be familiar with the `OWASP Top 10`, the list spotlighting critical vulnerabilities affecting `web applications`. OWASP also publishes a `Top 10` specifically focused on API vulnerabilities, known as the `OWASP API Security Top 10`. This list, essential for securing modern API-driven architectures, includes:

- Broken Object Level Authorization 
- Broken User Authentication
- Excessive Data Exposure
- Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting
- Broken Function Level Authorization
- Mass Assignment
- Security Misconfiguration 
- Injection
- Improper Asset Management
- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

Many of these vulnerabilities impact components beyond just `APIs`, but they frequently emerge in API environments. Today, we’re diving into `OWASP API #3`, **Excessive Data Exposure**, a risk often overlooked yet critically exploitable.

### OWASP API Security #3 - Excessive Data Exposure

**Excessive Data Exposure** arises when an API response reveals more information than intended or necessary for end users. It's a frequent vulnerability that I've encountered while bug hunting and often overlooked as an API-specific threat. Let’s break down what this vulnerability entails, how I typically detect it, and practical steps to mitigate it.

Consider a typical scenario where a web application requests data from an API service, which then populates a web page with this data in a user’s browser.

```
user <----------------- application -------------------> API service
         (browser)                (API client) 
```

For many APIs, the `API client` lacks control over which specific data fields are returned. Take, for instance, a case where an API is used to retrieve user profile information for a web page:

```
https://api.example.com/v1.1/users/show?user_id=12
```

An API response might return the entire user object, as follows:

```json
{ 
  "id": 6253282, 
  "username": "z0rs", 
  "screen_name": "Eno", 
  "location": "Blk 335 Smith Street", 
  "bio": "Hacker.",
  "api_token": "8a48c14b04d94d81ca484e8f32daf6dc", 
  "phone_number": "123-456-7890", 
  "address": "Blk 335 Smith Street, SG" 
}
```

In this example, the response includes sensitive fields (`API token`, `phone number`, and `address`) that the client-side application doesn’t need to display. This becomes problematic when developers assume unneeded fields won’t be visible to users, relying on client-side code to filter sensitive data before rendering it. But, if the entire API response reaches the browser, anyone can intercept it and view the sensitive data. 

Attackers might also exploit this by intercepting API traffic (e.g., through MITM attacks) to extract sensitive data from other users.

### Preventing Excessive Data Exposure

Excessive data exposure typically happens when the API client doesn’t filter out unneeded data fields before rendering the response. Here’s how to address it:

1. **Client-Side Filtering:** Ensure the client application only displays essential data. Filter sensitive fields in the client code before sending data to the user interface.

2. **Server-Side Optimization:** When possible, configure the `API server` to return only the fields needed for each specific request. In flexible APIs like `GraphQL`, for example, you can define precise fields in queries to limit response data. This way, the API server sends only essential data, minimizing exposure risks.

3. **Secure Data Transmission:** Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted in transit using secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS/TLS) to prevent exposure through network traffic interception.

### Practical Bug Hunting for Data Exposure

As a bug hunter and tester, I’m always on the lookout for `keywords` like `key`, `token`, and `secret` in API responses to detect data leaks. Too often, sensitive information slips through due to unfiltered `API server` responses, where the entire object is returned without filtering out unneeded fields before sending it to the client.

Excessive Data Exposure is, unfortunately, a pervasive issue. When combined with `OWASP API #4` (Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting), it can amplify risks significantly, leading to more complex attack vectors and potential data breaches.

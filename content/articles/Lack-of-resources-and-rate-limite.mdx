![API Security - Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x3n0/0x3n0.github.io/master/assets/img/blogging/Lack-of-Resources-%26-Rate-Limiting.jpg)  
_API Security Fundamentals: Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting_

Alright, if you're into security, you‚Äôve probably heard of the `OWASP Top 10`. It‚Äôs basically the Hall of Shame for web app vulnerabilities. But APIs got their own set of nightmares‚Äîmeet the `API Security Top 10`. Here‚Äôs the list:

- Broken Object Level Authorization
- Broken User Authentication
- Excessive Data Exposure
- Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting
- Broken Function Level Authorization
- Mass Assignment
- Security Misconfiguration
- Injection
- Improper Assets Management
- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

Most of these don‚Äôt just mess with APIs but can wreck entire applications. But today, we‚Äôre zooming in on `#4`: **Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting**. Let‚Äôs break it down.

## What‚Äôs the Deal with Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting?

This happens when an API doesn‚Äôt put a cap on how many requests a client can make. No brakes = free-for-all. If there‚Äôs no rate limiting, an API client could spam thousands of requests per second or pull ridiculous amounts of data in one go, turning your server into a smoldering wreck.

### Why Should You Care?

First off, no rate limits = easy DoS (Denial of Service) attack. A single overenthusiastic client‚Äîor worse, an army of bots‚Äîcan flood your API, making it unusable for legit users.

Second, attackers love APIs with no limits. No rate caps mean brute-force attacks on login endpoints become a cakewalk. If `Broken Object Level Authorization` is also in play, it‚Äôs a buffet for hackers.

And let‚Äôs not forget data scraping. If your API dishes out sensitive info without restrictions, someone‚Äôs gonna take advantage. Imagine an endpoint that returns emails‚Äîwithout limits, an attacker could scoop up thousands in minutes.

### Real-World Example: API Abuse in Injection Attacks

Check out this API call:

```http
https://api.example.com/v1.1/emails/view?user_id=123&entries=20
```

Now, if there‚Äôs no rate limiting, an attacker could max out the request:

```http
https://api.example.com/v1.1/emails/view?user_id=123&entries=5000
```

Or just loop through a bunch of user IDs and scrape everything:

```http
https://api.example.com/v1.1/profile/email/view?user_id=1337
https://api.example.com/v1.1/profile/email/view?user_id=124
https://api.example.com/v1.1/profile/email/view?user_id=125
...
https://api.example.com/v1.1/profile/email/view?user_id=2345
```

### How to Not Screw This Up

So, how do you stop your API from becoming a hacker‚Äôs playground? Enforce rate limits. Sounds easy, but getting it right is another story.

Not all API endpoints are equal. Login endpoints need stricter limits than, say, a public news feed. The trick is figuring out ‚Äúnormal‚Äù behavior and flagging requests that go off the rails.

When setting limits, think about what‚Äôs at risk. Stay sharp, because in the next part, we‚Äôll talk about another API security fail: `OWASP API Security #5` - [**Broken Function Level Authorization**](https://0x3n0.github.io/Function-Level-Authorizationd). You‚Äôll wanna stick around for that one. üöÄ

_API Security Fundamentals: Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting_

You’re probably familiar with the `OWASP Top 10`, highlighting the most critical web application vulnerabilities. In addition to general web application risks, OWASP has also released an `API Security Top 10` that specifically addresses API vulnerabilities. Here’s the current list:

- Broken Object Level Authorization
- Broken User Authentication
- Excessive Data Exposure
- Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting
- Broken Function Level Authorization
- Mass Assignment
- Security Misconfiguration
- Injection
- Improper Assets Management
- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

Many of these issues impact not just APIs but other application components, though APIs are particularly susceptible. In this article, we’ll break down `OWASP API Security #4`: **Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting**.

## What Is OWASP API Security Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting?

Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting in API security occurs when the API fails to enforce limits on the volume or frequency of requests from a given API client. Without such controls, clients can potentially make thousands of API calls per second or request extensive data records in a single request, overwhelming the server.

### Why Is Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting a Problem?

Firstly, not enforcing rate limits can severely affect `API server` performance, exposing systems to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. A client (or multiple clients) making numerous simultaneous requests can exceed the server’s capacity, slowing it down or rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users.

Additionally, without rate limiting, attackers can launch brute-force attacks targeting authentication and authorization, particularly if `Broken Object Level Authorization` vulnerabilities exist. For example, if the API does not limit login attempts, an attacker can brute-force passwords by sending repeated login requests until a match is found.

Another issue is sensitive data exposure. When `Rate Limiting` is absent, attackers can exploit the vulnerability to harvest large amounts of sensitive data quickly, especially if the API lacks robust access controls. Consider an API that retrieves user emails without restrictions, returning a batch of emails with a single call.

### OWASP API Security Example: Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting in Injection Attacks

The following example demonstrates how resource limits can expose sensitive data.

```http
https://api.example.com/v1.1/emails/view?user_id=123&entries=20
```

In cases without rate limits, an attacker could escalate this to request a larger batch:

```http
https://api.example.com/v1.1/emails/view?user_id=123&entries=5000
```

Additionally, an attacker can loop through multiple `user_id`s to scrape emails, running numerous requests as follows:

```http
https://api.example.com/v1.1/profile/email/view?user_id=1337
https://api.example.com/v1.1/profile/email/view?user_id=124
https://api.example.com/v1.1/profile/email/view?user_id=125
...
https://api.example.com/v1.1/profile/email/view?user_id=2345
```

### How to Prevent Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting Issues

So, what steps can help prevent these issues? Enforcing strict access limits is crucial, though implementing it correctly can be challenging.

Different functions require unique thresholds. For example, authentication-related endpoints should have lower rate limits to deter `brute-forcing` attacks. A good first step is identifying what constitutes "normal usage" for each function and blocking requests that significantly exceed this baseline.

When determining rate limit thresholds, consider the risks unique to your API context. Stay tuned for the next part, where we’ll explore another critical API issue: `OWASP API Security #5` - [**Broken Function Level Authorization**](https://0x3n0.github.io/Function-Level-Authorizationd), and why it’s essential to audit sensitive functions in your API.

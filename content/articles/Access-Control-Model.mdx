Modern web applications often require complex access control models, allowing developers to define granular permissions for users within an organization. This capability is fundamental to API security, as it restricts access based on defined roles, minimizing attack surfaces while enabling seamless collaboration.

## What is an Access Control Model?

An Access Control Model regulates user access to resources, defining how they can interact with them. Within a web application context, it’s the underlying framework that restricts access based on user roles. For instance, an administrator might be granted access to all organizational resources, whereas regular members have access to a subset of data based on their specific role permissions.

In a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) example, three roles could be set up with distinct permissions. An admin, for instance, would access `All(users, documents, logs, and reports)`, while a manager might access `users`, `documents`, and `reports`. Regular users would be limited further, perhaps only able to view `users` and `documents`.

To gain a clearer understanding, let’s explore the types of Access Control Models commonly used today:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Grants permissions based on a user’s role within the organization, streamlining permission management by grouping users with similar access needs.

- **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**: Permissions are assigned based on access policies set by the asset owner, providing flexibility but introducing risks when misconfigured.

- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**: Common in government or military systems, MAC assigns sensitivity labels to resources (e.g., confidential, secret, top-secret) and restricts access accordingly.

## Broken Access Control: A Critical Vulnerability

Web applications have become more sophisticated and, consequently, harder to secure. Misconfigurations or poor design in an Access Control Model often lead to vulnerabilities known as `Broken Access Control`. This flaw can grant unauthorized users access to restricted information, making the application an attractive target for attackers.

## Common Access Control Errors

When implementing an Access Control Model, missteps can result in critical security gaps. Common issues include:

- **Permissions Not Applied Correctly**: Permissions might not be enforced properly, allowing unauthorized access. For instance, if `/api/users` requires `read:users` permission, an attacker could potentially access it without having the proper `read:users` permission.

- **Permission X Overrides Permission Y**: An unintended privilege might override another, allowing access to broader resources. For example, a `read:users` permission granting implicit access to `/api/reports`, enabling `read:reports` unintentionally.

- **Random Permission Combinations**: Certain combinations of permissions might unintentionally grant additional access, allowing permissions like `read:X` and `read:Y` to also grant `read:Z`.

The challenge lies in designing a penetration testing methodology that addresses these potential issues effectively. We can apply specific techniques to simulate each scenario, covering as many variations of access control failures as possible.

## Testing Broken Access Control Models

Let’s dive into techniques for testing broken access controls. Over the years, as pentesters and analysts, we’ve identified some highly effective methods to assess API access control weaknesses:

- **Forward Approach**: Users are granted access to one permission at a time and test for unauthorized access to restricted APIs sequentially. This ensures that permissions are restricted to intended endpoints only.

#### Example of Forward Approach:

A user is granted `read:users` permission and attempts to access other restricted APIs within the permission model.

- **Backward Approach**: Users are assigned all permissions except one, then try to access the restricted API associated with the omitted permission. This tests if the absence of a specific permission restricts access appropriately.

#### Example of Backward Approach:

A user is granted all permissions except `read:users`, then attempts to access user data from `GET /api/users`.

- **Mixed Approach**: Users are invited with a random combination of permissions to test against restricted API endpoints associated with other roles. This ensures no unintentional privilege escalations.

#### Example of Mixed Approach:

A user is given permissions `read:users`, `write:docs`, and `write:logs` and then tested against restricted endpoints.

## Closing Thoughts

API endpoints should reference identifiers (name, ID, or UID) only within intended scopes. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) are a form of access control weakness, though not all access control issues are classified as IDORs.
